## Motivation
In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, maintaining close, intentional, and loving relationships can be challenging, especially for young adults juggling various life changes and digital distractions. As two 21-year-old students, we have experienced firsthand how difficult it can be to stay connected with those who matter most. We believe that fostering and maintaining genuine relationships is crucial for personal growth, combating mental health issues, and empowering individuals to take control of their social lives. HeartSprouts was born out of this realization, aiming to bridge the gap between digital convenience and meaningful human connections.

HeartSprouts empowers users to nurture and sustain genuine connections with friends and family amidst the demands of modern life. By providing timely reminders, insightful prompts, and a platform for intentional interactions, we hope to make maintaining relationships easier and more fulfilling.
