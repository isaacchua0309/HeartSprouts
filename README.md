## Motivation
In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, maintaining close, intentional, and loving relationships can be challenging, especially for young adults juggling various life changes and digital distractions. As two 21-year-old students, we have experienced firsthand how difficult it can be to stay connected with those who matter most. We believe that fostering and maintaining genuine relationships is crucial for personal growth, combating mental health issues, and empowering individuals to take control of their social lives. HeartSprouts was born out of this realization, aiming to bridge the gap between digital convenience and meaningful human connections.

## Aim
Our aim is to create a mobile application that serves as a personal relationship companion for young adults. HeartSprouts empowers users to nurture and sustain genuine connections with friends and family amidst the demands of modern life. By providing timely reminders, insightful prompts, and a platform for intentional interactions, we hope to make maintaining relationships easier and more fulfilling.

## User Stories
- **Create Profiles**: As a young adult who wants to stay connected with my friends and family, I want to create profiles for each of my close relationships, including details like hobbies, birthdays, and important milestones. This helps me remember key details about my loved ones and makes interactions more personal.
- **Regular Communication**: As a young adult who values regular communication, I want to receive reminders to check in on my friends and family members. These reminders help me stay in touch and maintain regular contact.
- **Remember Important Dates**: As a young adult who tends to forget important dates, I want to receive reminders for birthdays, outings, and other significant events. This ensures that I never miss an important occasion.
- **Weekly Reflection**: As a young adult who wants to deepen my understanding of my relationships, I want to receive weekly reflection prompts. These prompts encourage me to think about my interactions and how I can improve them.
- **Social Outing Prep**: As a young adult preparing for a social outing, I want to receive a reminder with details about my friend. This helps me prepare for meaningful conversations and shows that I care.
- **Daily Inspiration**: As a young adult seeking inspiration, I want to receive a daily prompt encouraging intentional actions or conversations. These prompts motivate me to take small but meaningful steps to strengthen my relationships.

#### Mood Tracking Flow
1. User selects their current mood from the MoodOverlay.
2. The selected mood is stored in Firestore.
3. The HomeScreen displays a motivational quote based on the selected mood and updates the pet image accordingly.

## User Research Samples and Examples

#### Sample 1: Initial Usability Testing

**Objective**: To assess the overall usability of the HeartSprouts app and identify any immediate issues with navigation and key features.

**Participants**: 10 young adults aged 18-25.

**Methodology**:
- Participants were asked to perform a series of tasks, including creating a profile, adding a friend and setting a reminder
- Screen recordings and user input logs were collected.
- Post-test surveys and interviews were conducted to gather qualitative feedback.

**Key Findings**:
1. **Navigation Issues**: Several participants found it difficult to navigate from the Home screen to the Add Friend screen.
   - **Conclusion**: The navigation bar needs clearer icons and labels. We should consider adding a tutorial or onboarding guide for first-time users.

2. **Profile Creation Confusion**: Some users were confused about the steps required to complete the profile creation process.
   - **Conclusion**: Simplify the profile creation process and providing clearer instructions at each step.

3. **Reminder Settings**: Users appreciated the reminder feature but wanted more customization options (e.g., setting specific times for reminders).
   - **Conclusion**: Enhance the reminder feature by allowing users to set specific times and customize reminder messages.

#### Sample 2: Focus Group Discussions

**Objective**: To gain deeper insights into user motivations and preferences for features related to maintaining relationships.

**Participants**: 8 young adults from diverse backgrounds.

**Methodology**:
- Conducted two focus group sessions, each lasting 1.5 hours.
- Participants discussed their experiences with the app, their relationship maintenance habits, and their feature preferences.

**Key Findings**:
1. **Personal Connection**: Users emphasized the importance of features that help them feel more connected on a personal level, such as sharing memories or photos.
   - **Conclusion**: Introduce features that allow users to share photos, notes, and memories with their friends and family members.

2. **Customization**: Participants wanted more ways to customize their experience, such as personalized themes and notification sounds.
   - **Conclusion**: Add customization options for themes, notification sounds, and display preferences to enhance user experience.

3. **Integration with Other Apps**: Users expressed interest in integrating HeartSprouts with other apps like calendars and social media platforms.
   - **Conclusion**: Explore possibilities for integrating with popular calendar apps and social media platforms to provide a seamless experience for users.

4. **Privacy Concerns**: Some participants were concerned about the privacy of their data, particularly personal details of their friends.
   - **Conclusion**: Strengthen privacy policies and provide transparent information on data usage. Implement robust security measures to protect user data.

---

By conducting these user research activities, HeartSprouts can continuously refine and improve its features, ensuring that the app meets the needs and preferences of its target audience.

## Design Principles and Patterns

HeartSprouts follows several software design principles and patterns to ensure maintainability, scalability, and robustness.

### SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
   - **Description:** A class should have one and only one reason to change.
   - **Implementation:** Each screen and component in HeartSprouts has a specific responsibility.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
   - **Description:** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - **Implementation:** Use of abstract classes and interfaces to allow extension without modifying existing code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
   - **Description:** Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the functionality.
   - **Implementation:** Ensuring subclass implementations maintain the behavior expected by the superclass.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**
   - **Description:** Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.
   - **Implementation:** Creating specific interfaces for different functionalities.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
   - **Description:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but on abstractions.
   - **Implementation:** Use of dependency injection and inversion of control (IoC) containers.

### Other Principles

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**
   - **Description:** Avoid code duplication by abstracting common functionality.
   - **Implementation:** Shared components and utility functions.

2. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):**
   - **Description:** Keep the code as simple as possible.
   - **Implementation:** Simple and readable code with clear documentation.

3. **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):**
   - **Description:** Only implement features when they are needed.
   - **Implementation:** Incremental development and avoiding over-engineering.

### Design Patterns

1. **Factory Method:**
   - **Usage:** Creating different types of user accounts and events.
   - **Example:** `createAccount` function to generate user profiles.

2. **Observer Pattern:**
   - **Usage:** Notifying users of changes in mood tracking or journal entries.
   - **Example:** Real-time updates on mood changes.

3. **Singleton Pattern:**
   - **Usage:** Ensuring a single instance of the Firebase connection.
   - **Example:** Firebase configuration module.

4. **Decorator Pattern:**
   - **Usage:** Adding additional functionality to components without modifying their code.
   - **Example:** Enhancing UI components with additional styles or behaviors.

5. **Facade Pattern:**
   - **Usage:** Simplifying interactions with complex subsystems.
   - **Example:** A single API for managing user profiles and events.

6. **Strategy Pattern:**
   - **Usage:** Defining different algorithms for user interactions.
   - **Example:** Different strategies for handling user inputs and navigation.
